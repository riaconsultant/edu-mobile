### School Management System: Menu Design Based on Actors

Below is a streamlined **menu structure** for a School Management System (SMS) tailored to each key actor (Parent, Student, Staff, Principal, Librarian, Class Teacher). The design focuses on a **best-in-class application**, incorporating all essential and advanced modules for optimal functionality, without tier-based distinctions. Each actor’s menu is crafted for intuitive navigation, aligning with their roles and responsibilities. Menus are structured as they would appear in a web or mobile app interface, with **use case examples** to illustrate practical application. All modules assume modern features like cloud-based access, mobile app support, AI-driven insights, and third-party integrations (e.g., Google Workspace, Zoom, payment gateways).

#### Actors and Their Menu Modules

Each actor has a role-specific dashboard with menu items reflecting their primary tasks. Access levels ensure data security and relevance, with permissions enforced via role-based authentication.

- **Design Principles**: Menus are intuitive, with responsive design for web and mobile apps. Each actor sees only relevant modules, enforced by role-based access control (RBAC). Dashboards use clean layouts with quick-access buttons and search functionality.
- **Features**: All modules include modern capabilities like AI analytics, real-time notifications, and integrations (e.g., Zoom for meetings, Stripe for payments, Google Calendar for scheduling). Security features include MFA and encrypted data storage for GDPR/HIPAA compliance.
- **Scalability**: Designed for schools of all sizes, from small academies to multi-campus universities. Cloud-based deployment ensures accessibility, with on-premise options for data-sensitive institutions.
- **Customization**: Admins (e.g., Principal) can tailor menus or workflows using low-code tools. Training (~1–2 days) and data migration support are included for seamless adoption.

These menus provide a comprehensive, user-centric interface for each actor, with use cases ensuring practical applicability. If you need wireframes, detailed module workflows, or a sample UI design (e.g., in HTML/CSS), let me know!
